        <h3 id="one">What ia Covid-19?</h3>
        <P>A coronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat. Most coronaviruses aren't dangerous.
    
            In early 2020, after a December 2019 outbreak in China, the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world.
            
            COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection. It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).
            
            It spreads the same way other coronaviruses do, mainly through person-to-person contact. Infections range from mild to deadly.
            
            SARS-CoV-2 is one of seven types of coronavirus, including the ones that cause severe diseases like Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The other coronaviruses cause most of the colds that affect us during the year but aren’t a serious threat for otherwise healthy people.</P>

    <div class="two">
        <h3 id="two">Why is it called coronavirus?</h3>
        <p>Coronaviruses are named for their appearance: “corona” means “crown.” The virus’s outer layers are covered with spike proteins that surround them like a crown.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="three">
        <H3 id="three">How does the coronavirus spread?</H3>
        <img src="causes.jpg" alt="causes of coronavirus">
        <p>As of now, researchers know that the coronavirus is spread through droplets and virus particles released into the air when an infected person breathes, talks, laughs, sings, coughs or sneezes. Larger droplets may fall to the ground in a few seconds, but tiny infectious particles can linger in the air and accumulate in indoor places, especially where many people are gathered and there is poor ventilation. This is why mask-wearing, hand hygiene and physical distancing are essential to preventing COVID-19.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="four">
        <h3 id="four">How did the corona virus start?</h3>
        <p>The first case of COVID-19 was reported Dec. 1, 2019, and the cause was a then-new coronavirus later named SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in an animal and changed (mutated) so it could cause illness in humans. In the past, several infectious disease outbreaks have been traced to viruses originating in birds, pigs, bats and other animals that mutated to become dangerous to humans. Research continues, and more study may reveal how and why the coronavirus evolved to cause pandemic disease.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="one">
        <h3 id="five">What is the incubation period for COVID-19?</h3>
        <p>Symptoms show up in people within two to 14 days of exposure to the virus. A person infected with the coronavirus is contagious to others for up to two days before symptoms appear, and they remain contagious to others for 10 to 20 days, depending upon their immune system and the severity of their illness. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="two">
        <h3 id="six">What are symptoms of coronavirus?</h3>
        <img src="symtoms.jpg" alt="symtoms of corona virus">
        <p>
            COVID-19 symptoms include:
            <ul class="five">
                <li>Cough</li>
                <li>Fever or chills</li>
                <li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
                <li>Muscle or body aches</li>
                <li>Sore throat</li>
                <li>New loss of taste or smell</li>
                <li>Diarrhea</li>
                <li>Headache</li>
                <li>New fatigue</li>
                <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
                <li>Congestion or runny nose</li>
            </ul>
            Some people infected with the coronavirus have mild COVID-19 illness, and others have no symptoms at all. In some cases, however, COVID-19 can lead to respiratory failure, lasting lung and heart muscle damage, nervous system problems, kidney failure or death.

        <h3 id="seven">Can coronavirus be transmitted through groceries, packages, or food?</h3>
        <p>You’re much more likely to get COVID-19 from another person than from packages, groceries, or food. If you’re in a high-risk group, stay home and use a delivery service or have a friend shop for you. Have them leave the items outside your front door, if you can. If you do your own shopping, wear and cloth face mask and try to stay at least 6 feet away from other shoppers.

            Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds before and after bringing things into your home. The coronavirus can linger on hard surfaces, so clean and disinfect countertops and anything else your bags have touched. You can wipe down plastic, metal, or glass packaging with soap and water if you want.
            
            There’s no evidence that anyone has gotten COVID-19 from food or food containers.

        <img src="prevention1.jpg" alt="prevetion of coronavirus">
        <p>
            Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 is a key part of prevention. But you should also take these steps:
            <ul>
               <li> <strong>Cover your nose and mouth in public.</strong>  If you have COVID-19, you can spread it even if you don’t feel sick. Wear a cloth face covering to protect others. This isn’t a replacement for social distancing. You still need to keep a 6-foot distance between yourself and those around you. Don’t use a face mask meant for health care workers. And don’t put a face covering on anyone who is:</li>
               <ol class="five">
                   <li>Under 2 years old</li>
                   <li>Having trouble breathing</li>
                   <li>Unconscious or can’t remove the mask on their own for other reasons</li>
               </ol>
               <li> <strong>Wash your hands often with soap and water or clean them with an alcohol-based sanitizer.</strong>  This kills viruses on your hands.</li>
               <li> <strong>Don’t touch your face.</strong>  Coronaviruses can live on surfaces you touch for several hours. If they get on your hands and you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth, they can get into your body.</li>
               <li> <strong>Practice social distancing.</strong>  Because you can have and spread the virus without knowing it, you should stay home as much as possible. If you do have to go out, stay at least 6 feet away from others.</li>
               <li> <strong>Clean and disinfect.</strong>  You can clean first with soap and water, but disinfect surfaces you touch often, like tables, doorknobs, light switches, toilets, faucets, and sinks. Use a mix of household bleach and water (1/3 cup bleach per gallon of water, or 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water) or a household cleaner that’s approved to treat SARS-CoV-2. You can check the ,<a href="https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/about-list-n-disinfectants-coronavirus-covid-19-0">Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) website </a> to see if yours made the list. Wear gloves when you clean and throw them away when you’re done.</li>
             </ul>
             There’s no proof that herbal therapies and teas can prevent infection.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="one">
        <h3 id="nine">Can a face mask protect you from infection?</h3>
        <p>The CDC recommends that if you are not vaccinated, you should wear a cloth face mask if you go out in public. If you are at home with someone who has been infected or exposed, you should wear it as well. A mask is an added layer of protection for everyone, on top of social distancing efforts. You can spread the virus when you talk or cough, even if you don’t know that you have it or if you aren’t showing signs of infection.

            The CDC advises that surgical masks and N95 masks should be reserved for health care workers and first responders.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="two">
        <h3 id="ten">Are there different variants of this coronavirus?</h3>
        <img src="cover1.jpg" alt="coronavirus1">
        <p>Yes, there are different variants of this coronavirus. Like other viruses, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 can change (mutate). In December 2020, B.1.1.7, a new variant, was identified in the United Kingdom, and since then, variants have appeared in other locations around the world, including B.1.351, first isolated in South Africa, and others. Mutations may enable the coronavirus to spread faster from person to person, and may cause more severe disease. More infections can result in more people getting very sick and also create more opportunity for the virus to develop further mutations.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="three">
       <h3 id="eleven">What should you do in quarantine or isolation?</h3>">
       
       <p>
        <ul class="five">
            <li>If you are within the limits of your home, do not leave unless it is necessary. Do not attend functions, school, churches or temples.</li>
            <li>Pets can stay: There is no evidence that Coronavirus can spread to your pets. However, it is advised to avoid petting, snuggling or cuddling with your pet if you have been exposed to COVID-19.</li>
            <li>Do not share: Keep your plates, glasses, cups, spoons, towels, and bedding separate. Do not swap any of these items unwashed.</li>
            <li>Frequent hand washing is a must: Hygiene is a very integral part of a quarantine. Wash your hands for twenty seconds with soap and water frequently. Use your elbow to cough or sneeze into or use a tissue and immediately throw it in a covered dustbin.</li>
            <li>Stay calm: While it is natural to feel anxious and scared, being educated about your situation is a great way to combat anxiety.</li>
            <li>Follow instructions and co-operate with the authorities: Following the quarantine process and other public health mandates play a big role in preventing and slowing the spread of contagious diseases.</li>
 
        </ul>
        Being cooped up indoors may seem unbearable, but remember that your actions are helping save the lives of many people.
